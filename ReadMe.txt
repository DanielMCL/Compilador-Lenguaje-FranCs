Compiler for made-up programming language "FranCs". 

To use make sure [input name] has a correct code in FranCs and type the following comands.
java -cp "cup.jar:." constructorast.Main  Inputs/[input name] (for example Input/input.txt)
./wat2wasm main.wat
node main.js
Afterwards, the program will wait for 2 inputs. If no input is needed by the code, press enter twice.
